# android-kotlin-architecture
This is an Android project that serves as a showcase for an app following a Clean architecture approach. This is a result of an iteration over different approaches we've been using in [Moove-it](http://www.moove-it.com) apps. This is a mix from [Android Clean Architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture) and [Moove-it Android Arquitecture temple](https://github.com/moove-it/android-arquitecture-template) which suited us best for our needs
